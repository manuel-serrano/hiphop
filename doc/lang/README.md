The HipHop Programming Language
===============================

HipHop is a _synchronous programming_ language. It supports sequence,
parallelism, preemption, instantaneous communication between components
by the means of signals, and it is _deterministic_. A HipHop program 
executes by reacting to external events. Each of these executions is called
a _reaction_ or an _instant_. It is the role of JavaScript to decide when
a HipHop program should execute its next instant. 

During a HipHop reaction, all components see the very same
information.  For instance, all compoments share the same information
about signals that have been emitted or not. Programs are to be _causal_.
That is:

  1. programs have only one possible unambigious execution path and during;
  2. programs cannot contradict themselves during a reaction, that is, they
  can perform an action that contradict a decision already take during the
  reaction;
  3. programs cannot take decision based on action not already executed during
  the reaction;
  4. programs cannot execute infinite loop during a reaction.
  
Programs that do not respect these four rules are rejected, either 
statically or dynamically. See the section [Errors](./lang/error.md)
for examples of incorrect programs.


Syntax and JavaScript embedding
-------------------------------

> [!WARNING]
> HipHop requires the program to use ECMAScript modules.

The HipHop syntax extends the JavaScript syntax with one single
statement:

```ebnf
  hiphop <HHstatement>
```

The `hiphop` tag is to be followd by a HipHop statement, whose
syntax is described in this [bnf grammar](syntax/hiphop.bnf).

This chapter documents the HipHop programming language.  The
connection with JavaScript is described in chapter [api](./api.md) and
the standard HipHop modules are described in chapter [standard
modules](./stdmod.md).
