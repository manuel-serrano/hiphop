synchronous concurrency and preemption to \js. Inspired from Esterel, HipHop.js
simplifies the programming of non-trivial temporal behaviors as found
in complex web interfaces or IoT controllers and the cooperation
between synchronous and asynchronous activities. HipHop.js is compiled into
plain sequential \js and executes on unmodified runtime environments.
We use three examples to present and discuss HipHop.js: a simple web login
form to introduce the language and show how it differs from \js, and
two real life examples, a medical prescription pillbox and an
interactive music system that show why concurrency and preemption help
programming such temporal applications."

Rich applications merge classical computing, client-server
concurrency, web-based interfaces, and the complex time- and
event-based reactive programming found in embedded systems. To handle
them, we extend the Hop web programming platform by HipHop, a
domain-specific language dedicated to event-based process
orchestration. Borrowing the synchronous reactive model of Esterel,
HipHop is based on synchronous concurrency and preemption primitives
that are known to be key components for the modular design of complex
reactive behaviors. HipHop departs from Esterel by its ability to
handle the dynamicity of Web applications, thanks to the reflexivity
of Hop.  Using a music player example, we show how to modularly build
a non-trivial Hop application using HipHop orchestration code.

HOP is a SCHEME-based language and system to build rich multi-tier
web applications. We present HIPHOP, a new language layer within
HOP dedicated to request and event orchestration. HIPHOP follows the
synchronous reactive model of the Esterel and ReactiveC languages,
originally developed for embedded systems programming. It is based on
synchronous concurrency and preemption primitives, which are known to
be key components for the modular design of complex temporal
behaviors. Although the language is concurrent, the generated code is
purely sequential and thread-free; HIPHOP is translated to HOP for the
server side and to straight JavaScript for the client side.  With a
music playing example, we show how to modularly buid non-trivial
orchestration code with HIPHOP},
